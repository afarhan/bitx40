 * The setFrequency is a little tricky routine, it works differently for USB and LSB

 * The BITX BFO is permanently set to lower sideband, (that is, the crystal frequency

 * 
 * LSB: The VFO frequency is subtracted from the BFO. Suppose the BFO is set to exactly 12 MHz
 * and the VFO is at 5 MHz. The output will be at 12.000 - 5.000  = 7.000 MHz
 * 
 * USB: The BFO is subtracted from the VFO. Makes the LSB signal of the BITX come out as USB!!
 * Here is how it will work:
 * Consider that you want to transmit on 14.000 MHz and you have the BFO at 12.000 MHz. We set
 * the VFO to 26.000 MHz. Hence, 26.000 - 12.000 = 14.000 MHz. Now, consider you are whistling a tone
 * of 1 KHz. As the BITX BFO is set to produce LSB, the output from the crystal filter will be 11.999 MHz.
 * With the VFO still at 26.000, the 14 Mhz output will now be 26.000 - 11.999 = 14.001, hence, as the
 * frequencies of your voice go down at the IF, the RF frequencies will go up!

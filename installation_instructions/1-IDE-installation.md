# Installing the Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a piece of software that is needed to "compile" the software and then upload it to the Arduino microcontroller chip.
The Raduino software (or "sketch") is written in C (a programming language). The program statements in the sketch must be "translated" to digital instruction codes that the Arduino microcontroller can understand and execute. This translation process is called "compiling".

The Arduino IDE software can be downloaded for free from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
